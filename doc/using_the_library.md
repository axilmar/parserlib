# Parserlib

## Using the library

`Parserlib` is a heavily templated `c++` library, and therefore it lives only as a set of headers, which are located in the `include` folder.

In order to be used, these headers should be put somewhere in a project's include path.

The main header, that includes everything, is `parserlib.hpp`.

The namespace is `parserlib`.

The following code includes the main header and uses the library's namespace:

```cpp
#include "parserlib.hpp"
using namespace parserlib;
```
